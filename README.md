## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a character from the Citadel, a pure logic-driven technocrat, has their first undeniable, sensor-defying experience of the land's sentience.
- Draft a 'lore-fragment' from Old Finn's archives: a myth about the creation of the Hearthenge, written in a blend of poetry and practical ecological instruction.
- Create a confrontation between Kaelen and Head Councilman Aron, where Aron's love for his people and his engineer's mindset clash with Kaelen's ontological truths.
- Imagine a chapter from the perspective of the Whisperwood itself, describing the arrival of the Citadel delegation and the settlement of Firstfall as sensations, irritations, or curiosities.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a 'symbiotic interface' prototype: a speculative technology that translates biological stress signals (from trees, mycelium, water) into human-interpretable data without extraction, inspired by Kaelen's listening.
- Outline a 'Resurgence Database' schema for cataloging indigenous and mythopoeic knowledge in a way that protects its context and prevents commodification, a tool for lore-keepers like Finn.
